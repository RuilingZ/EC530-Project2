# Project2: Patient Care API

## Overview
Implement a healthcare application one module at a time.  My branching strategy is to develop modules (i.e. device modules) in separate branches, and once these modules have been tested, they will be merged with the main branch. The final project will be completed in the main branch.


## Module
In this module, the task is to define an interface, the patient application of equipment can be through the interface to the data of intake system 
The received data is checked for any errors and pushed to the data management module for storage in the master database.
